# Write a Python program to add two numbers.
a = input("Enter first number: ")
b = input("Enter second number: ")

sum = float(a) + float(b)

print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is: {sum}")
# Note: Ensure that the inputs are valid numbers to avoid ValueError.
# This program takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.
